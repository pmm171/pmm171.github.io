        <h3>TAH #12 – Chris King, Voice of Washington State Cougars</h3>

        <p>In the 12th episode of “The Announcer’s Hour” podcast, Chris King joins me to chat about his time as the “Voice of the Vandals” and his prior stops in baseball.</p>

        <p>In his current role, King is responsible for play-by-play duties for Washington State Cougars football and men’s basketball games. Right before landing in Pullman, King served as the Deputy Commissioner and Media & Communications director for the West Coast League.</p>

        <p>King has made several stops in baseball and started in the West Coast League as the play-by-play man for the Wenatchee AppleSox. After, King moved to the Northwest League and was a longtime (2012-2021) radio broadcaster for the Tri-City Dust Devils, the High-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. King has been named the Idaho Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sports Media Association in 2017 and 2023.</p>
