        <h3>Episode 9 - Michael Potter, Voice of Grand Canyon Antelopes</h3>

        <p>In the ninth episode of “The Announcer’s Hour” podcast, Michael Potter joins me to talk about his experience in the broadcast booth.</p>

        <p>Potter is the voice of the Grand Canyon Antelopes in the Division I Western Athletic Conference. Potter is heard on 1580 The Fanatic in Phoenix for every ‘Lopes basketball game and covers many GCU baseball games on ESPN+. In addition, Potter works with the Western Athletic Conference and jumps on play-by-play duties for several of the conference’s television broadcasts.</p>

        <p>In addition, Potter worked with the Pac-12 Network in the past and was once a student at Grand Canyon University, calling games when the Antelopes were out of Division I competition. Potter talks about his time in Los Angeles, California and the way he got his start in broadcasting in the Golden State.</p>
