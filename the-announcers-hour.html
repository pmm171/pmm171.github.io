        <h3>Episode 3 - Andrés Tejeda, Rockford IceHogs Broadcast Team</h3>

        <p>In the third episode of “The Announcer’s Hour” podcast, Andrés Tejeda joins me to discuss how his young broadcasting career is going. Tejada takes us through some of the better stories you may only witness roaming the sidelines and dugouts at the developmental level of sports.</p>

        <p>Tejeda is the Pregame Show Host for the Rockford Ice Hogs (Affiliate of the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks). Tejeda is only a couple years removed from college graduation but has called games on radio and television for the university of St. Thomas, the California Winter League, ESPN+, Colby Community College, and the Clinton LumberKings of the Prospect League.</p>

        <p>While in Minnesota, Tejeda worked as a broadcast production assistant for the Minnesota Twins in 2021 and earned the chance to interview Twins players, host shows on the Twins Radio Network, and learn from longtime broadcasters Corey Provus and others.</p>

        <p>Follow Tejeda on Twitter (X) - @AndresOnAir</p>
