        <h3>TAH #13 – Adam Young, Voice of New Mexico State Aggies</h3>

        <p>In the 13th episode of “The Announcer’s Hour” podcast, Adam Young joins me to chat about his role as the voice of the New Mexico State Aggies and his experience in television play-by-play for several NCAA games and events.</p>

        <p>Young is the Director of Broadcasting for New Mexico State and serves as the play-by-play voice for several Aggies sports (football, men’s basketball, women’s basketball, baseball, volleyball, softball, and soccer). In addition, Young will host a weekly Radio Coaches Show on the Aggies Network.</p>

        <p>Before New Mexico State, Young developed his roots in the Midwest. In the St. Louis area, Young served as the voice of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and the Gateway Grizzlies baseball team. With 1380 ESPN, Young served as a reporter for the St. Louis Cardinals and later handled public address announcing for St. Louis University (SLU). With SLU, Young filled in as a play-by-play voice for the SLU Billikens men’s basketball team. Young graduated from SIUE with a B.A. in Mass Communication and a minor in Speech Communication. </p>
