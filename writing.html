        <h2>Miami Hurricanes Baseball Game Story</h2>

        <h3><a href="https://themiamihurricane.com/2023/02/19/miami-wins-opening-series-against-penn-state-thanks-to-kayfus-walk-off-homer/">Miami wins opening series against Penn State thanks to Kayfus' walk-off homer</a></h3>

        <p>Sunday might have been slow at Mark Light Field, but the grand moment — a walk-off home run by first baseman CJ Kayfus — was more than worth the wait.</p>

        <p>“Not quite the way we drew it up,” Miami head coach Gino DiMare said. “Proud of our guys for fighting back and being able to pull through and get the victory.”</p>

        <p>In a 3-2 win over Penn State, Miami was less than comfortable the whole game.</p>

        <p>When Kayfus stepped up to the plate in the ninth inning, it seemed nothing was going right for him or the team. The 6-foot junior had yet to get a hit in three at–bats, and the ‘Canes trailed 2-1.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the Hurricanes had just lost a replay review that confirmed shortstop Dominic Pitelli was thrown out at second base. Then, outfielder Dario Gomez struck out on the next pitch to give Miami a quick two outs.</p>

        <p>“We had a miscommunication with the sign. We had the sac bunt on, but Dom [Pitelli] didn’t see it,” DiMare said.</p>

        <p>Getting the smallest bit of life from an Edgardo Villegas single, Kayfus stepped up and swung at the first pitch from Penn State reliever Steven Miller. The ball sailed over the right–field wall to lift the Hurricanes to victory.</p>

        <p>“I was just trying to get to the next guy,” Kayfus said. “I hit it and I was like, ‘I just won the game. No doubt whatsoever.’”</p>

        <p>However, most of the game was slow–paced, as the Hurricanes never scored against Penn State starter Tommy Molsky. The right-handed sophomore finished his day with only three hits allowed in five innings pitched.</p>

        <p>Miami starter Alejandro Rosario was also solid.</p>

        <p>“Rosario did an excellent job,” DiMare said. “He should not have been out after five and a third. We got two double plays we didn’t turn. That made him throw more pitches.”</p>

        <p>In 5.1 innings pitched, Rosario allowed only two runs on 94 pitches. The starter gave up four hits and struck out six but struggled with location at times. Rosario walked four batters, and his wild pitch in the third allowed designated hitter Thomas Bramley to score.</p>

        <p>“Loved the way he handled himself, loved his composure,” DiMare said of Rosario. “Still want him to be a little more sharp with his command.”</p>

        <p>As the lineup struggled, Miami turned to its youth. The Hurricanes sent freshman Blake Cyr to the plate in the sixth, and his single scored FGCU transfer Ian Farrow to put Miami on the board, making the score 2-1.</p>

        <p>“I was just really focused, knew what I had to do,” Cyr said. “Penn State came out and battled, but I just knew I had to be a good teammate and get the job done and score that run to get us going.”</p>

        <p>Under the pressure of a struggling offense, Miami’s relievers stepped up in a big way. In 3.2 innings of work, Chris Scinta, along with Brian and Andrew Walters, did not allow a single run.</p>

        <p>“Chris Scinta threw great. Freshman came in and threw great, excellent. Bases loaded, got out of the jam,” DiMare said.</p>

        <p>Set up by timely pitching and a clutch base hit from Villegas, Miami was finally able to overcome the strong pitching of Penn State and earn the win on Kafyus’ ninth–inning homer.</p>

        <p>“Big at bat by Eddy Villegas. Huge, or we don’t walk off,” DiMare said.</p>

        <p>On the mound, Andrew Walters (1-0) earned the win for his efforts, while Miller (0-1) was handed the loss for allowing the home run to Kayfus.</p>

        <p>Next up, the Hurricanes face the Stetson Hatters on Tuesday night. First pitch is set for 6 p.m. at Mark Light Field.</p>

        <h2>Miami Hurricanes Basketball Coach Larrañaga Profile</h2>

        <h3><a href="https://themiamihurricane.com/2023/04/12/miamis-run-to-the-final-four-proves-no-mountain-is-too-high-for-jim-larraaga-to-reach/">Miami’s run to the Final Four proves no mountain is too high for Jim Larrañaga to reach</a></h3>

        <p>Miami head coach Jim Larrañaga moves around the arena at a slow pace. He follows a simple routine of cereal in the morning. This diet is supplemented by trips to Smoothie King when he needs to fill up with a treat.</p>

        <p>For the second time in a row, the relatable 73-year-old man took his team to an Elite Eight matchup after a victory in the Sweet 16 against the No. 1 seed Houston Cougars. After downing the Texas Longhorns 87-81 in comeback fashion, Miami advanced to its first-ever Final Four.</p>

        <p>“We went on a run offensively, defensively, and that completely turned the game around. When it got to be 75-75, we’ve been in so many close games this year, I felt very comfortable and confident these guys will pull us through,” Larrañaga said after beating Texas.</p>

        <p>For such an occasion, the locker-room dancing, joyous older man could only smile as he threw on his shirt, which read “Champs,” with “The Final Chapter” lettered in bold underneath.</p>

        <p>“I love these guys. They’re all terrific. Their personalities are just sensational,” Larrañaga said.</p>

        <p>Miami was eventually eliminated by a dominant buzzsaw. The UConn Huskies earned the title of the best team in college basketball in 2023. Their 72-59, Final Four victory against the ‘Canes was their slimmest margin of victory throughout their six-game journey in the NCAA Tournament.</p>

        <p>“Only one team wins it,” Larrañaga told reporters outside the Watsco Center after the loss to Connecticut. “To accomplish what we did, getting to the Final Four for the first time in [the] school’s history is something to be very proud of. I told our players, I’ve told our fans, ‘This is a lifelong memory, you will never forget this.”</p>

        <p>Unlike the 73-year-old Larrañaga, the Hurricanes basketball team he coached all season long played at a blazing pace, able to run by opponents with relative ease. In 37 games, Miami faced a variety of challenges from around the country, from conference foe Duke to the best two teams in “The Lone Star State”: Texas and Houston.</p>
        
        <p>Miami handled almost every challenge in its path. The Hurricanes won a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) regular season title, avoided an upset against Drake, then trounced two consecutive higher-seeded teams in Indiana and Houston. Then, they still had time for a comeback victory against another favored opponent to advance to their first Final Four in school history.</p>

        <p>In each circumstance, Larrañaga adjusted to his opponent’s strengths and weaknesses with the weapons on the roster, leaving the opposition with little to counter with.</p>

        <p>“We played a lot of seven-footers this year. None of them bothered us,” Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson said of Miami’s Norchad Omier. “They were never a factor with us. This kid was because of how good he is.”</p>

        <p>Even as some of Miami’s players simmered down, others on the roster found a way. Without Omier for parts of the game against Texas, Larrañaga leaned on senior Jordan Miller to come through with 27 points, while the coach elected to sit his frontcourt player on the bench for much of the first half to avoid any worse foul trouble.</p>

        <p>“My coaches are saying don’t take him out because he only has one foul,” Larrañaga said. “He’s a very aggressive player.”</p>

        <p>Making the chess move early, Larrañaga was able to save Omier’s abilities for the final minutes of the game, where the Nicaraguan was able to finish the game without fouling out.</p>

        <p>The long tenured coach has been the only constant during years of building Miami basketball. The Hurricanes were unable to reach the NCAA Tournament in six of Larrañaga’s 12 seasons with the team. Even when the Hurricanes did make it, they failed to ever advance past the Sweet 16 until last year. It has hardly been a linear path, and Miami has grown exponentially in the last two seasons, as Larrañaga has stuck around for it all.</p>

        <p>“When people are watching us on TV, the next thing they do, oh, I don’t know much about the University of Miami,” Larrañaga said. “Let me go check that out on their website. Then all of a sudden, we get more applications to our university.”</p>

        <p>Miami ultimately couldn’t rise to the challenge of winning its coveted first national title in school history. If this season is any indication, however, that title may not be far away.</p>

        <p>Larrañaga last led his team to the Final Four in 2006. The George Mason Patriots made it to the last region of the tournament before bowing out to the eventual champion Florida Gators. The Patriots were the No. 11 seed in the tournament.</p>

        <p>“It’s the same exhilaration. Just, the jubilant attitude, the effort because you just love it when your players accomplish a goal they set out before the season,” Larrañaga said after beating Texas. “What we said in the first day of practice ‘we got to start visualizing what we want to accomplish right now and be working towards that every single day, and that is what these guys have done.”</p>

        <p>At this point, however, the Hurricanes hardly feel like a Cinderella story, as did the Patriots many years ago. Miami is a more rounded and explosive team than George Mason was. It reached the Elite Eight two years in a row and showed a clear ability to replace the key pieces that left.</p>

        <p>“We can say, ‘we were in the Final Four now we’re trying to win a national championship.’ I think every high school player who followed March Madness, every college basketball player who’s thinking about entering his name into the transfer portal. I’m absolutely certain Miami will come up in their conversations,” Larrañaga said.</p>

        <p>With prior success and new weapons to take advantage of Name, Image and Likeness (NIL), it won’t be as difficult for Miami to consistently bring in better players that will help it stay atop the ACC.</p>

        <p>“The guys make my job so enjoyable,” Larrañaga said. “Why would I retire and do nothing as compared to have so much fun being around 18 to 23-year-olds who play basketball, a sport that I love.”</p>

        <h2>Miami Hurricanes Women's Basketball Game Story</h2>

        <h3>Hurricanes conquer slow start, trounce Eagles in runaway victory</h3>

        <p>The start wasn’t as pretty as the finish for the Miami Hurricanes, but all that mattered was the final score: UM 86, Boston College 65.</p>

        <p>“It was a very physical game, but it was nice to see that toughness from our team,” Miami Head coach Katie Meier said after her team’s Thursday victory at the Watsco Center.</p>

        <p>Breaking out of the gate like a horse at Belmont, Boston College (13-10, 3-7 ACC) found itself playing with a sizeable lead early on. Utilizing four 3-pointers, three of which came from Junior guard Jojo Lacey, the Eagles took a 14-2 advantage with 5:31 to play in the first quarter.</p>

        <p>“They don’t let you run your sets,” Meier said. “It took us a while to adjust.”</p>

        <p>Miami (13-7, 6-3 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)) slimmed the deficit to eight by the end of the first quarter. Holding Boston College to zero field goals in the last 2:59 seconds of the opening quarter, the ‘Canes cut the score to 26-18.</p>

        <p>In the second quarter, Miami started to find some offensive life. Lifting the student section crowd under the sign marked “Category 5” to their feet, the Hurricanes put together a run to cut the deficit to three. During the 9-2 run that made it 34-31 with 4:44 left in the half, freshman Lazaria Spearman scored five. Spearman finished with 7 points after 11 minutes of action.</p>
        
        <p>Down 41-37 out of the halftime break, Haley Cavinder wasn’t having her greatest day through the first half. She scored no points and missed four shots in the first two quarters.</p>

        <p>For Cavinder, the cold streak didn’t last much longer. Scoring her first basket with 7:05 left in the third quarter, the Fresno State transfer then scored three of the Hurricanes next four buckets.</p>

        <p>“She just raised her level of the game,” Meier said. “I never doubt that she is going to bounce back.”</p>

        <p>After taking its first lead of the night with 5:45 left in the quarter, Miami started to pour it on. A flurry of different scorers gave the Eagles trouble.</p>

        <p>“We were struggling and then those kids came back,” Meier said. “It was nice, we were all in it together.”</p>

        <p>Giving a big hug to graduate guard Karla Erjavec as she exited the floor after hitting a three-pointer, Meier was exuberant to suddenly see her team up 66-56 with 1:06 left to play in the third quarter.</p>

        <p>“Karla’s performance was so meaningful for our team,” Meier said. “She’s been struggling, she admits it, but she’s just had a real positive attitude all week.”</p>

        <p>Consistent all night long, the ‘Canes were led by Destiny Harden and her 23 points and career best seven steals. Also a career high, Harden made 11 of her 16 free throw attempts.</p>

        <p>“I always practice my free throws as if I’m in the game,” Harden said.</p>

        <p>Amongst others big scorers, Dwyer notched 12 points and finished with five steals. </p>

        <p>“We spent a lot of time on her, this is a special young player in our conference,” Meier said.</p>

        <p>Erjavec scored 13 points, about 10 above her season average of 3.4 per game.</p>

        <p>Defending the lead in the fourth quarter, the ‘Canes continued to run away with the contest as the squad forced 27 turnovers from Boston College.</p>

        <p>“This was a separation game. It is one of those games where it can really help you, and it can really hurt you,” Meier said.</p>

        <p>After the win, Miami will travel to Wake Forest for a Sunday matinee. The Hurricanes will face a Demon Deacons team they beat 55-43 on Jan. 15. Tipoff is scheduled for 2:00 on Sunday.</p>

        <h2>Miami Heat Game Story</h2>

        <h3>Miami overcomes poor defensive first quarter, wins shootout vs. Atlanta on Monday Night</h3>

        <p>It was an awkward Monday night at Miami-Dade Arena. One of the rarer scenarios in NBA basketball, the Miami Heat hosted the Atlanta Hawks for the second time in a row.</p>

        <p>Even more strange, both teams were sliding as they came into the game but still looked remarkable, going back and forth in an amazing offensive game. In the end, it was the hometown Heat who got it done 130-128, its second highest point total of the season.</p>

        <p>“A lot of brilliant, inspiring plays,” Miami head coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I thought our bench, our second unit was outstanding.”</p>
        
        <p>Entering the game, Atlanta was on a four-game road skid while Miami had lost six of its last eight games.</p>

        <p>Trying to break its streak, Atlanta helped itself tremendously by beginning the game incredibly hot. Putting up 43 in the first quarter, the Hawks led 43-30 as the teams from the Southeast Division entered the second quarter.</p>
        
        <p>For Miami, it was the most points the team had allowed to an opponent in any one quarter all season.</p>

        <p>“I think we just had to play harder,” Miami guard Gabe Vincent said of the defensive adjustments after the first quarter. “They have high offensive talent.”</p>

        <p>The scoring attack was well rounded for Atlanta as it held onto its lead into the halftime break, 68-63. Through two quarters, Center Clint Capela had 10, former Washington Husky Dejounte Murray had scored 10 points while he dished out five assists. Spreading the offense even more, 30-year-old Bogdan Bogdanović had an additional 10 points for the Hawks through two quarters.</p>

        <p>Though down early, Miami wouldn’t quit on its difficult mission of beating the same opponent two times in a row. Off the bench, the 205-pound Caleb Martin had led the way in the early goings and finished with 21 in about 28 minutes of action.</p>

        <p>“He’s our version of the matrix,” Spoelstra said of Martin, a reference to former NBA star Shawn Marion. “He’s just so active and inspiring.”</p>

        <p>After an eight-point first half, Heat forward Jimmy Butler finished one rebound and assist shy of a triple-double, pouring in 18 in the second half to get 26 total points.</p>

        <p>“Jimmy, he’s one of the most selfless superstars in the game,” Vincent said.</p>

        <p>Aided by 10 made 3-pointers in 20 attempts through three quarters, Miami tightened the margin to a 96-92 Atlanta lead entering the final quarter.</p>

        <p>The Heat, symbolic of its nickname, caught fire as it needed to in the fourth quarter. After tying the game at 100, Miami used a couple of Bam Adebayo free throws and a Victor Oladipo alley oop dunk from Duncan Robinson to jam into a 104-100 lead with 9:22 remaining, forcing the Hawks to take a timeout.</p>

        <p>“I been trying to catch a lob all year,” Oladipo said. “Big shout out to Duncan, that was a great pass by him.”</p>

        <p>Oladipo finished with 21 points, hitting four threes and five free throws.</p>

        <p>“It’s important not only for my game but for my team as well,” Oladipo said. “It helps our team down the stretch.”</p>

        <p>Adebayo hit all six of his free throw attempts in route to an efficient 16-point night.</p>

        <p>“We had our rim attacks, we had our free throws. We were able to get Jimmy to the line, Bam to the line,” Spoelstra said.</p>

        <p>After taking the lead, Miami forced the Hawks to play from behind but never let them catch back up. Atlanta was eventually forced to foul, but Butler hit both free throws at the line with 1.6 seconds to go to seal a 130-128 victory.</p>

        <p>Miami will host another short, two game series which starts Wednesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Tipoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. from Miami-Dade Arena.</p>

        <h2>Miami Marlins Game Story</h2>

        <h3>Marlins regain winning record behind Soler's pinch-hit big fly, beat Giants 4-3.</h3>

        <p> It took a long time to develop, but the Miami Marlins eventually overcame the San Francisco Giants ground ball pitcher Logan Webb. Plating the winning run in a 4-3 victory, Jorge Soler stepped into the box in place of shortstop Garrett Hampson in the seventh inning and hit a towering two-run home run to put the Marlins ahead.</p>

        <p>“Winning kind of makes everything better,” Miami catcher Jacob Stallings said before the game. “We’ve had a really hard schedule too. We’ve beaten some really good teams.”</p>

        <p>After allowing Soler to hit his first pinch hit home run since September 21 of 2015 when he was with the Chicago Cubs, Webb was removed from the game. The 6-foot-1 righty went 6.2 innings, allowing four runs on eight hits in 105 pitches.</p>

        <p>Despite postponements in travel from Miami to Detroit, delaying the arrival of the team until Monday morning, the Giants had no problem waking up the bats in front of 8744 fans at Loan Depot Park in the early part of the ball game.</p>

        <p>Twenty-three-year-old Heliot Ramos earned his first career RBI by doubling over left fielder Bryan De La Cruz’s head to bring home catcher Joey Bart in the second inning. After, the Giants (5-10) scratched for two more in the third inning when the former South Florida Bull David Villar notched his third double of the season to score designated hitter Darin Ruf and first baseman Wilmer Flores.</p>

        <p>Miami (9-8) countered in the bottom of the third as fan favorite Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled to center field to score Jesus Sanchez.</p>

        <p>“He’s got a good attitude. For me, it’s all about the process and not the results. So, if the process is there he can do whatever he needs to do,” Miami Marlins first base coach Jon Jay said of Chisholm’s efforts to break his slower start to the season.</p>

        <p>Through five innings, the Giants held a 3-1 lead.</p>

        <p>Marlins starter Jesus Luzardo kept Miami in the game. By the end of his outing, Luzardo just missed out on the quality start as he went 4.1 innings. The 6-foot lefty allowed six hits, striking out as many hitters in 100 pitches. He was relieved by four pitchers, none of whom gave up a run.</p>

        <p>“He’s a special, special talent,” Stallings said. “He’s really starting to put it together I would say the last year and a half or so.”</p>

        <p>Entering the game with a 21-25 record against Miami since 2015, San Francisco’s troubled past against the Marlins started to catch up to the team as the two-hour, 19-minute game moved along.</p>

        <p>In the sixth inning, Miami’s flaming hot hitter Luis Arraez drove in Chisholm Jr. with an RBI single to close the gap to just one run. Soon after, the Marlins would take the lead for good behind Soler’s two-run home run in the seventh.</p>

        <p>“Luis is the type of guy who is prepared. Like, if you watch him behind the scenes and everything he does he’s prepared to go out there and play baseball,” Jay said before the game. “He brings a lot of energy which I think is really good for this team.”</p>

        <p>Up 4-3 in the ninth inning, closer A.J. Puk needed three outs. The 27-year-old collected his second save of the season with 11 pitches, capturing the victory for the Marlins.</p>

        <p>“Our pitching has done really well, our bullpen has been really good,” Stallings said. “I think there is just a different belief with our group this year.”</p>

        <p>Pitching a scoreless seventh inning, Miami reliever Matt Barnes earned the win (1-0) while Webb (0-4) was handed the loss.</p>

        <p>Miami will play in Game 2 of the series against the Giants Tuesday at 6:40 p.m. before heading to Cleveland to face the Guardians for a three-game weekend series.</p>

        <h2>Miami Open Tennis Match Story</h2>

        <h3>Top 40 duo of Paul and Shelton combine to earn close Thursday victory over young Damm and Shang at Miami Open</h3>

        <p>Just one day removed from 28,132 people filling the stands on Wednesday at Hard Rock Stadium, Thursday’s Miami Open tennis matches brought even more excitement.</p>

        <p>Court three shared most of that positive sentiment at about 5:45 in the afternoon as the gallery cheered on the entrance of Americans Tommy Paul, Ben Shelton, Martin Damm and the sole man from China, Juncheng Shang. After the group of four split into two pairs, Paul and Shelton scraped by with a 6-7, 6-3, 10-8 win.</p>

        <p>“I think the biggest thing is that they are both used to this stage a little more,” Damm said. “I think the nerves got to us, especially to me a little bit.”</p>

        <p>The first set of the match laid down a competitive tone for the rest of the night. Fighting back and forth, the home crowd roared mostly in the favor of Paul and Shelton as the two continued to keep it close after falling behind early.</p>

        <p>“The crowd was amazing, even though they were for them most of the time,” Damm said, a Bradenton, Florida native. “I wish we could have more of these tournaments close to home.”</p>

        <p>In the crucial tiebreaking game after the first set was undetermined at six per side, Damm fired the ball just passed the outstretched effort of Paul to win 7-6.</p>

        <p>Through the crowd noise of thousands in the stands, Damm only needed a few connections in the gallery to feel embraced.</p>

        <p>“Even though we had just a few people there, knowing they are going to be behind us 100 percent of the time, it was a great feeling,” Damm said. “I think that they helped us make this match this close.”</p>

        <p>More would be needed to put down the talented duo of Paul and the former Florida Gator Shelton. The two are ranked at No. 19 and No. 39 in the world in singles, respectively. With so much talent, the duo responded with a quick 6-3 victory in the second set.</p>

        <p>“I think that we needed to do a better job of bringing the energy together, making some decisive plays,” Damm said. “Most importantly, they started trading better, especially on Jerry’s serves.”</p>

        <p>The last time the two shared the court, Paul bounced Shelton from the Australian Open in the quarterfinals of the tournament.</p>

        <p>“It was a really cool experience, and the Aussie people were amazing, but since I’ve been back, it’s been back to normal life,” Florida native Shelton said in an interview with the Miami Herald.</p>

        <p>Throwing rankings and expectations to the side, the players locked into another battle in the third set. Reaching the first water break in the 10-point tiebreaker, the doubles were locked up at 3-3.</p>

        <p>With both teams communicating after each point, the talented duo of Paul and Shelton couldn’t help but pump their fists in excitement as their lead grew to 8-5.</p>

        <p>A last-ditch effort by the IMG Academy duo of Damm and Shang wouldn’t be enough. The 19-year-old Damm couldn’t counter a ball coming across the net down 9-8, giving Paul and Shelton the final point to win the match as the flood lights drowned the hard court in Miami Gardens.</p>

        <p>“It was great to play against them and me knowing Ben since we were 11 years old and being very, very good friends and you know Tommy and I get along pretty well,” Damm said. “Four guys, you get along well and are all friends. Super fun, exciting to be a part of.”</p>

        <p>The Miami Open will continue Friday with massive amounts of action until winners are decided on April 2nd.</p>
