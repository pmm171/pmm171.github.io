        <h2>Play-by-Play</h2>

        <p>With a driving passion to announce sports, I chose the University of Miami to pursue my beginnings in the space of play-by-play.</p>

        <p>With WVUM 90.5 FM, I was fortunate to call Hurricanes football, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball, volleyball, and soccer. Getting the chance to call these games was a privilege and incredibly fun.</p>

        <p>Recently, the Quincy Gems of the Prospect League gave me the chance to broadcast all Gems home games on Prospect League Television for the <time datetime="2023">2023</time> season. In the role, I broadcasted each game solo, giving me a mass of experience in the wonderful game of baseball.</p>

        <p>Working in front of the camera is a necessity in the realm of television. Through experiences with UMTV, WGEM, and other works, I have grown comfortable in front of the lens.</p>

        <p>Telling visual stories has always been a passion of mine. While in Miami, I have worked on television packages, shorter voice over segments, and other works.</p>

        <p>The television work has not just been allocated for class, but the University of Miami’s television show “SportsDesk.” While in Quincy with the Gems, I assisted WGEM TV, the local NBC affiliate and television station. The position allowed me to gain more experience with tighter deadlines and real-world newsgathering for broadcast.</p>

        <p>Amongst the bigger projects, I helped create a documentary over the course of a semester in Miami Beach. Covering an important race for the Miami Beach commissioner role, I learned more about the flexibility and time management skills necessary to perform a media project over a longer period.</p>

        <p>At Miami, I worked in behind the scenes television production for both <abbr title="University of Miami Television">UMTV</abbr> shows SportsDesk and NewsVision. In combination with classwork, I have filled the seats of many positions in the studio including director, technical director, server operator, camera operator, audio engineer, floor manager, teleprompter, and more.</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>

        <p>I have a strong passion for storytelling, and sports are an incredibly useful medium for helping me pursue this passion. After beginning writing for “The Corral” at Parkway Central High School, I expanded my sports writing experience to Miami, writing for the school newspaper “The Miami Hurricane.” In addition, I currently write for the website FanBuzz.com.</p>

        <p>During the spring semester of <time datetime="2023">2023</time> I wrote game recaps of several professional sporting events in Miami, being trained by one of the best, longtime sports reporters of the Miami Herald. While on deadline, I had the privilege of writing a game story for a Miami Heat game, a Miami Marlins game, an Inter Miami CF game, and a tennis match story at the Miami Open.</p>
