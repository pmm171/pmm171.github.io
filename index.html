        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello there! My name is Patrick McColl, I am a student studying broadcast journalism at the University of Miami. I have a serious interest in doing play-by-play sports broadcasting and I am in the process of getting as much as experience in the field as possible. I have been able to work extensively with WVUM 90.5 FM to broadcast Hurricanes baseball, football, men's and women's basketball, soccer, and volleyball.</p>

        <p>I have been able to work in front of the camera while with the University of Miami Television (UMTV). I have been able to shot packages, stand ups, and live shots. Each have been filmed with a different story and purpose. Some of these examples are in my Jim Nantz Award Submission.</p>

        <p>I have been fortunate to work in the television control room and out in the field operating as a multimedia jouranlist with UMTV and as a print journalist with The Miami Hurricane and FanBuzz.</p>

        <p>I have had the pleasure of interviewing subjects and getting real world experience in filming and reporting.</p>
